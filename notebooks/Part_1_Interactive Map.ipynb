    "# Capstone Project: Predicting NYC Taxi Fare\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine stepping off a plane at JFK Airport, tired and eager to get to Midtown Manhattan. As you hail a taxi, you might wonder—how much will this ride cost?  \n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to answer that question by predicting NYC taxi fares using trip data. It includes:\n",
    "- An **interactive map** that visualizes key patterns, such as pickup and dropoff locations, high-demand areas like Midtown Manhattan and the Financial District, and popular landmarks.\n",
    "- Two predictive models—**Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regression**—built to estimate taxi fares based on trip details such as distance, passenger count, and time of day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through data exploration, modeling, and visualization, this project highlights the factors influencing fare variability and provides practical tools for decision-making. \n"
